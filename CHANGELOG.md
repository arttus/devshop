# 1.0.0-rc1 (%)

% Commits to Devmaster https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/1.0.0-beta10...1.x

- Update Drupal Core to 7.54.
- Update Drupal Contrib.
- Add Hosting HTTPS to allow LetsEncrypt automated certificates for HTTPS. (Experimental)
- Moved git handling to Hosting Git Module! One more step towards moving devshop into Aegir. Platforms are now saved using the git ref from the project.
- Added a docker-compose.yml file for launching in Docker. Tuned for local development but can be adapted for production use.
- Moved Documentation to a dedicated repository: https://github.com/opendevshop/documentation
- Added a Robofile.php for easy launching and development. Install the Robo CLI and `robo up` to get a running devshop on Docker. See http://robo.li/ for more information.
- Standardized on using `robo` commands for local dev and Travis testing.
- Removed old `tests/docker-launch.sh` and `tests/docker-destroy.sh` scripts, now that we have robo.
- Improved Travis CI testing: Now installs using Docker, and with Ansible, on both CentOS and Ubuntu. Upgrade is tested as well.
- Pushed devmaster back into drupal.org and refactored makefiles to make it more of a true distribution. See https://www.drupal.org/project/devmaster.
- Added geerlingguy.composer Ansible role.
- Added `--name` option to `devshop devmaster:test` command to pass to bin/behat --name.
- Added `behat-path` option to `devshop devmaster:test` command to allow customizing which set of tests to run.
- Added `--makefile` option to `devshop upgrade` command to allow overriding the desired makefile.
- Removed the last remnants of our custom Ansible role files: This MOTD template never worked, anyway! https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/376a74f9db5d154fad05d6083f0f402ac0f19fba/templates/motd.j2
- Moved Behat tests for DevShop to Devmaster, since most (all?) of the code being tested is actually in that repository. Makes changing tests to adapt to changing functionality much easier if its in the same repository.
- Removed custom Dockerfiles used for testing.
- Deprecated the Vagrant based development environment, moving it into a subfolder.
- Added a separate Makefile in YML for development: ensures all projects are downloaded with git.  (devmaster.development.make.yml)
 - Fixed numerous bugs with Hosting Logs. Now you can easily make error logs available to uses, if needed.
 - Fixed DevShop Deploy, Aegir Commit, DevShop Acquia, DevShop Dothooks, and Aegir Download module to work with repo_path instead of repo_root.
 - Change the hook named `hook_devshop_environment_actions()` to `hook_devshop_environment_menu()`.f
 - Fix 2 problems with BitBucket forms and webhooks. From new contributor @josebc! https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/pull/73
 - Fix bug where "Import/Export Config" tasks would show for Drupal 7 sites. 
 - Adding Features Update and Features Revert to Environment Menu.
 - For Pull Request environments, add option to reinstall site on every git-push! This respects the "install method", allowing re-install of profile, re-sync from production, or import from external database!
 - Added ability to "Change Site Domain Name" by using the "migrate" task.
 - Temporarily removing "Fork Environment" feature, we will get it into Hosting Git in the next RC.
 - Configure a "Environment Domain Name Pattern" instead of "Base Url". Define your environment's URLs with a pattern like "@project.@environment.@hostname" or "@environment.domain.com".
 - In project drush aliases, just use 'parent' property to make our @project.env aliases work exactly like provision's.
 -  Renamed devshop_drush_process() to devshop_process();
 - Save environment settings into provision context data.
 - Fix bug preventing branch names from having "/" characters.
 - Removing custom drush command `devshop-install`. Now works with `hostmaster-install`.
 - Allow installation by multiple methods: Install profile, clone other environment, Import from SQL Database, or Empty Database!
 - Add more details to automatically generated behat.yml files.
 - Adding `--strict` to `bin/behat` command so that missing steps fail the process.
 - Remove DevShop Deploy queue since Hosting Git Platforms now handles that.
 - Make all URLs in Behat console output logs clickable. Useful in test results.
 - Bigger, Bolder empty projects page.
 - Plenty of UI enhancements:
   - Add "Install Method" and date to environment template.
    - Add Site Slogan bsck into page template.
    - Improve detection and messaging of environment state.
 - Remove loading of tons of git info from the command line for a significant performance boost.

- Removing old unused devshop-create and devshop-commit tasks.
- Improved tests:
  - On failure, echo last page source and watchdog logs.
- Enable fix_permissions and fix_ownership modules by default for better file management.

## Ansible Playbooks

- Rewrote ansible installer using @geerlingguy's Ansible Playbooks.
- Created aegir.user, aegir.apache, aegir.nginx, and aegir.devmaster roles to finalize DevMaster installation.
  - https://github.com/opendevshop/ansible-role-aegir-user

## New Features

- Git Submodules! Deploy tasks now run `git submodule update --init --recursive`, so if you want to keep certain modules in different git repos, devshop now makes that easy.
- Config Export and Import! DevShop & Aegir now give you a button to press to export your Drupal 8 config to files.  When you combine this with the Aegir Commit modules, you can Site Build, Export to disk, and commit to git without ever leaving your browser.
- Upgrade Drupal! Click the "Upgrade Drupal" button to run "drush pm-update" to get your core and contrib in line.
- Grouped Drush aliases! Each project now writes it's own drush aliases file, making it much easier to target an environment: 'drush @project.environment uli`

## D6 -> D7 Upgrade Fixes

- Fixed user redirection when running tasks. If fired from project dashboard, user is returned to project dashboard. If fired from environment dashboard, user is returned to environment dashboard.
- Fixed dynamic task status loading. Just sit back and watch tasks start and stop.
- Cleaned up styles for tasks widget, especially on the environments dashboard.
- A few missing links to the new hostmaster URL 'hosting_confirm/1' instead of node/1'

### Newly Redesigned Tasks

- *Recreate Features* button allows you to update some or all of your Features modules in one click. Yes, this is an old feature, but it needed some dusting off. We've decoupled the "recreate" process from the "commit" process, making it much easier to avoid mistakes.
- *Download Modules* button allows you download and commit modules to git with the press of a button, or you can save your commit for the...
- *Commit* button, in the *Git Information* panel.  This task allows you to easily fill in a commit message and commit some or all of your changes. The name and user in DevMaster is automatically passed to git, so keep your devshop users accurate and you will have accurate git history.

These new features are not enabled by default, yet.  To check them out, please enable `aegir_features`, `aegir_download`, and `aegir_commit`.

### UI Improvements

- *Git Information* tells you when you have untracked, modified, added or deleted files. It will indicate if the repo is ahead or behind. Click for a modal window showing you the current git status, last commit, and full git diff for every environment.
- Git reference displayed on environments is now loaded in *realtime*. 
- *Situational Indicators* now tell you more about what is happening with your environments, especially when something failed.
- Situational buttons now appear on failed tasks or disabled environments giving you easy access to your options, such as 'View Logs & Retry', or 'Destroy Environment'.
- Improve `devshop status` command, it now fully bootstraps the devmaster site to ensure it is working and properly exits with a non-zero exit code if something fails.
- Output devmaster drupal version and site URL in `devshop status` command.
- Use `devshop status` and `devshop login` at end of install script, making it much more friendly.
- Moved all commands to use devshop_drush_process() and our new logging system, making all task logs beautiful.
- Added a `theme('devshop_ascii', $string)` function for easy beautiful ascii color in browser.
- Fixed the problem of GitHub Pull Request Environments often causing the "Clone" task to fail, which would prevent the environment from being created. In addition, "Deploy" task would not run on Cloned sites.  Now, new PR environments are exact clones of live, on the same git ref. After that, a new "Deploy" task is created that runs all appropriate deploy hooks.
- Clones of locked environments are automatically unlocked, since they are assumed to be destructible. Be sure to check your environment settings if you need to lock environments.
- Removing our special devshop_tests drupal page, and altering the menu to allow access to test tasks to users with the permission "access test logs". Now github links to the correct place to view tests in action!
- Fixed the funky "Logs" page for environments, and removed devshop_logs.module altogether!
- Added a [Tour](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/#tour) section to the documentation with screenshots.


### System & DevShop Development Features

- NGINX! You can now install NGINX + PHP-FPM on the devmaster server using the install script option `--server-webserver=nginx`.
- Full test suite running on Travis-ci.org, on both repositories, for both NGINX and Apache, Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS7!.  See https://travis-ci.org/opendevshop/devmaster and https://travis-ci.org/opendevshop/devshop for more info.
- Refactored travis tests and install scripts to allow testing of Pull Requests on devmaster repo.
- DevShop Behat tests now run through entire project creation, even testing the environment was installed properly.
- Created `docker-development-environment.sh` to launch a DevShop development environment in docker!  See `docker-destroy-devshop.sh` to remove the containers.
- Adding a 'devshop devmaster:test` command to the CLI for easy Behat testing of the front-end.
- Added command line options to `install.sh` script: 
  - `--server-webserver` can be `apache` or `nginx`.  
  - `--hostname` will pass a desired hostname to ansible, which will change the hostname on the system.
  - `--makefile` passes a different "build-devmaster.make" file, allowing for pull request testing.
  - `--aegir_user_uid` will pass to ansible variables, setting the aegir user to use the desired UID.


### New Contributors!

We're so excited to welcome Andrew Rosborough (@arosboro) from DropForgeLabs.com, and Daniel Hesoyam (@Hesoyam) to OpenDevShop as our newest contributors!

Andrew did immense work on tests, NGINX, and our 1.x branch upgrading devmaster to Drupal 7.

Daniel submitted a small patch fixing a warning in old versions of Vagrant.

Welcome!

## 0.7.4 (January 15, 2016)

1 commits to DevShop: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.7.3...0.7.4
15 commits to DevMaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.7.3...0.7.4

- Fixed bug that blocked non-uid-1 users from cloning and forking environments.
- Now runs apt-get update before installing git.
- Added "Run Tests" to Project Settings "Default Deploy Hooks".
- Improvements to the way devshop_get_tasks() works, improving dynamic task loading performance.
- Major improvements to Environment status user interface. It now clearly states to the user what an environment is doing: "Creating environment", "Cloning Environment", "Deleting Environment", "Disabling Environment", "Clone failed", "Delete Failed", Etc.  Added separate "Site Destroy" and "Platform destroy" indicators.
- Major improvements to GitHub pull request environment interface. Now clearly shows PR number and environment name. Shows Pull request title as well.

## 0.7.3 (December 30, 2015)

22 commits to DevMaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.7.2...0.7.3

- Minor improvements to ajax task loader to improve performance: don't load deleted environments!
- Removing a couple of PHP notices.
- Separating node-site template to only affect sites that are in projects.
- UI Improvements: 
  - Don't show site-related links before there is a site.
  - Add "Aegir Site" and "Aegir Platform" links to the dropdown, if user has access.
  - Improving last task display: now displays text status. Much easier to tell the status, especially if you are color blind. 
  - Improved "disabled" and "deleting" environment indicators.
- Moved task icon/label/class determination to hook_load() so we don't have to do it in many places.
- Properly load clone task on target environment.
- Improve output for failed tasks, giving users buttons to take their next steps: "Retry" or "Destroy".
- Blocking clone tasks from being retried because old tasks will fail due to unversioned task arguments.
- Added "Project Messages" so we can inform the user of project wide problems (such as no deploy hooks configured.)
- Added a "release-prep.sh" and "release.sh" script to help make releases easier.

## 0.7.2 (December 23, 2015)

3 commits to DevMaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.7.1...0.7.2

- Fixing a slew of PHP notices.
- Removing Hosting Task Jenkins from the default build. It requires composer install, and we can't run that inside of hostmaster-migrate at the moment.

## 0.7.1 (December 23, 2015)

1 commit to DevShop.
Fixed a bug in the Install command when specifying a version.

## 0.7.0 (December 23, 2015)

71 commits to DevShop: https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0
20 commits to Devmaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0

## DevMaster Fixes

- Fixed "Last Task" bug that was causing inconsistent environment status displays.
- Re-opening GitHub pull requests will recreate the environment.
- Fixed "Login" modal window bug that prevented users from being able to log in to all environments.
- Added "Environment Warnings" display that shows problems to the user, such as "No deploy hooks configured".
- When a major problem is detected, such as "Installation failed", "Clone failed", we now show the user a message describing what happened, and offer Retry and Destroy buttons so they can take immediate action.
- When an environment is being created, instead of saying "Verify" the first time, it says "Cloning codebase".
- Adding a VERSION.txt file to the install profile to define the project's version.  Once we go to Drupal 7 we can move this to the .info file. 

## DevShop CLI Fixes

- Fixed versioning issues! 
  - Banished the /var/aegir/.devshop-version file.  
  - Separated DevShop CLI and DevMaster versions in the status command.
  - Improved how devshop CLI interprets it's version.  If on a branch, it now specifies the SHA as well.
- Major CLI Improvements:
  - Added "self-update" command for the CLI that uses Git! Once Phar integration is complete self-update will update the phar as well.
  - Added our own Application and Command classes inspired by composer.  Moving a lot of shared code to those classes.
  - Added a sweet new logo for the CLI.
  - Set the stage for packaging devshop CLI into a PHAR file: added box.json.  We will not distribute the Phar file until we know self-update fully works.
  - Moved the executable from `devshop` to `bin/devshop`.

**NOTES:**
- After installing this release (once you have the self-update command), always run `devshop self-update` before `devshop upgrade`.  We will soon add code to enforce this by checking to see if devshop CLI is out of date before an upgrade.
- We do not remove the old .devshop-version file for you automatically, but the `devshop status` command will warn you if it still exists.  Please remove `/var/aegir/.devshop-version` manually.

## Web Developer Improvements
- Added "DevShop dotHooks" module: Add deploy hooks to your project's source code in a `.hooks` or `.hooks.yml` file.  Easily hook into any task: verify, install, deploy, test, etc.  See [docs.devshop.support](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/deployment-hooks/#devshop-dothooks) for more information.
- Added "DevShop Acquia" module: Use Acquia Cloud Hooks as deploy hooks in devshop. See [docs.devshop.support](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/deployment-hooks-acquia/) for more information.  We had partial support but now, all acquia cloud hooks are supported, and logging is much more clear.

## User Interface Improvements
- Total redesign of Tasks and logs: now we only output the logs that are pertinent to developers.
- Dynamic task logs loading for all types. Now you can sit back and watch your tasks run, with only the logs you want to see appearing.
- Renamed "Update Status" button to "Cancel Task". (TODO: Fail the task if the button is pushed.)
- Much improved deploy hooks configuration: 
  - Each environment now displays the deploy hooks that are configured, making it clear what is supposed to happen every time you deploy.
  - Project defaults are passed to all environments.
  - Block environment-specific deploy hooks.
  - Standardized deploy hook form across environment settings, deploy task, etc.
  - Automated deploy tasks respect all deploy hook types.
- Added settings form for "DevShop Public Key", in case you have to rebuild your devshop server's public key.
- Fixing problems with Aegir Download module.
- Fixed up some quirks with dynamically updating environment status.
- Created "Hosting Task Jenkins" module, allowing you to setup jenkins to run all of your tasks.  See [Hosting Tasks: Jenkins README](https://github.com/opendevshop/hosting_task_jenkins/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
- Lots of subtle design improvements.

## Internal Development Improvements
- Added hook_devshop_environment_alter(): Allow other modules to alter the environment object
- Added composer.json to devmaster and devshop_provision.
- Swapped drush_shell_exec's for Symfony Process in devshop_provision.
- Swapped provision-git-deploy for Symfony GitWrapper in devshop_provision and devshop_projects.drush.inc.  
- Added a new drush log type: devshop_command + devshop_log + devshop_ok + devshop_error.  These will output logs in a new prettier format in the front-end.  Documentation coming soon.
- Finally fully moving devshop_provision to [github](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop_provision), Created proper tags and branches and cleaned up old ones.
- Adding a shared function for adding the deploy hooks checkboxes to all forms that need it:  devshop_environment_deploy_hooks_form()
- Cleaned out a lot of old code and comments.

# Documentation Improvements

## Legacy

The changelog began with version 0.1.0 so any changes prior to that can be seen by checking the tagged releases and reading git commit messages.

Before 0.1.0, devshop releases were tagged as if it were a module: 6.x-1.x.

There was a long history of addon modules for aegir before devshop. 

### Hosting & Provision Logs (December 20, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_logs
https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_logs

Improved error log handling by setting Apache logs to an aegir-readable location, and making
them accessible to users through the devshop UI and a URL on the site.

### Hosting & Provision Solr (September 12, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_solr
https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_solr

This module allows Solr servers to be added to Aegir. Once you have a server, you can give an Aegir Site a Solr database as easily as choosing it's DB Server.

### DevMaster (September 9, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/devmaster

It wasn't until September of 2012 that we decided we needed a dedicated install profile, 
separate from Aegir's Hostmaster.

### DevShop Hosting (March 1, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/devshop_hosting

Provided the front-end interface for DevShop before it was merged into the DevMaster install profile project.

https://www.drupal.org/project/devshop_provision

Provision drush commands for devshop. Still in use until 1.x release!

### Hosting Features (February 25, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_features

Allows Hostmaster users with the right permission to trigger a "Update & Commit Features" task. This re-creates all of a site's features (as in features.module features) and commits (and pushes) them

### Provision Git Features (February 25, 2012) 

https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_git_features

The backend commands that Hosting Features needs to work.

### Provision Git (February 21, 2012)
