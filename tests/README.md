DevShop on Docker
=================

We've toyed with this for a while but now it's time to get serious.

We are now using docker on Travis-ci.org.

DevShop runs much faster in docker containers than the Vagrant VM. I am going to start using for testing and development.

## Helper Scripts

I've written some helper scripts that should help:

`docker-launch.sh`
will launch a devshop server inside a docker container

`docker-test.sh`
Disables supervisor and hosting queued modules then runs `devshop test` inside the devshop docker container.

These are the same tests that travis uses.

`docker-destroy-devshop.sh:`
Kills and removes the containers, to clean up your system.

## Launching devshop on docker

To launch devshop on Docker:

1. Clone this repo. cd to this folder.
2. Edit your `/etc/hosts` file so that devshop.docker points to 127.0.0.1
2. Run the launch script `$ bash docker-launch.sh`.  Make sure you are using docker as your normal user, not root.
3. It will build the containers, run the install script, and then run the tests!
4. To "get into the server" as the aegir user:

    $ docker exec -ti devshop_server su - aegir
   
Then you can run the devshop or drush commands:

    $ devshop login
    
## Notes
   
   This is just an experiment at this point, but the same setup is used on every code push on travis-ci.org.
   
## Next steps: 

  Getting a volume mounted so we can use it for development.
  Create a `.terra.yml` file that can run devshop. Patch terra to make it work if need be.
